# RISC-V-Superscalar-32x32-Register-File-ALU

This repository aims to implement a superscalar 4-Read/2-Write register file. If implemented correctly, two different RISC-V should be able to execute completely in parallel. This is different than pipelining in that the instructions completely overlap with one another rather than stagger in multiple stage. To narrow the scope of this project, no pipelining was implemented — though in practice — a superscalar processor would indeed also implement a pipeline.
